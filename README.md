# Coursera_Capstone

This repository contains my project for the capstone course of the IBM Data Science program.
The goal of this project was to use k-means clustering of neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon, to determine optimal locations for a new Thai restaurant.
The Foursquare API was used to obtain geospatial location data, including the locations of existing Thai restaurants. These data were used to perform the clustering of neighborhoods. The results were cross-referenced with demographic census data to build a list of potential locations.

The notebook capstone-portland.ipynb contains the code used to perform the analysis.
The file Capstone_Presentation_Week2.pdf contains the final presentation for the project.
The other files are older iterations of these.
